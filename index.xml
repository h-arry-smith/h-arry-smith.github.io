      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping a &amp;lsquo;Master Action List&amp;rsquo; to ensure that the key ideas that I discover get implemented. It&amp;rsquo;s a way of resurfacing the applicable concepts from books, courses, videos in one place. Don&amp;rsquo;t store good ideas but actually complete them.
We don&amp;rsquo;t remember a huge amount of what we read. We act on even less of it. I am a veracious reader, reading between 4-6 books a month. Often when a book is particularly powerful, the ideas of the book stick with me forever.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see progress A few months a go I was driving my girlfriend crazy. I felt like I was accomplishing nothing. I was working hard than ever and I had nothing to show for it. Or so I thought. I felt like I was putting in the work but I had nothing to show for it. The truth was I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it. I&amp;rsquo;ve always believed that big results come from committing to long term progress.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m currently accepting projects, get in touch for an estimate &amp;rightarrow;     Customers first point of contact with your business is more and more likely to be your website.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at getting a new website for your business or project you know they aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap.
Costs range from anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand pounds. Website builders seem an attractive option for cost conscious business owners.</description>

      <description>Every new year, this year more than most, we ruminate on the future. For many, this means another yearly attempt at building exercise into their routines.
Often, they fail. I failed every year from 2010 to 2019.
Personal fitness has become a poisoned well of mis-information and cash-grabs. Information is either outdated, complex or designed to mislead you. Gyms leech your finances, paying for equipment you don&amp;rsquo;t understand and don&amp;rsquo;t need.</description>

      <description>Now I‚Äôm currently working on the CodeCademy Full Stack Developer career path. I&amp;rsquo;m getting distracted along the way.
I‚Äôm focused on building websites for my first professional clients, with some exciting projects on the way.
I‚Äôm reading Essentialism by Greg McKeown.
I‚Äôm learning all about leather craft at the moment. I‚Äôve been making wallets over and over.
I can‚Äôt go climbing at the moment, but as soon as I can, I‚Äôll be down the wall as much as possible.</description>
