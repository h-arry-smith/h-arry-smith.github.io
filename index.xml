      <description>Every new year, this year more than most, we ruminate on the future. For many, this means another yearly attempt at building exercise into their routines.
Often, they fail. I failed every year from 2010 to 2019.
Personal fitness has become a poisoned well of mis-information and cash-grabs. Information is either outdated, complex or designed to mislead you. Gyms leech your finances, paying for equipment you don&amp;rsquo;t understand and don&amp;rsquo;t need.</description>

      <description>now. I‚Äôm currently working on the CodeCademy Full Stack Developer career path. I&amp;rsquo;m getting distracted along the way.
I‚Äôm focused on building out this website, and making it useful.
I‚Äôm reading The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.
I‚Äôm learning all about leather craft at the moment. I‚Äôve been making wallets over and over.
I can‚Äôt go climbing at the moment, but as soon as I can, I‚Äôll be down the wall as much as possible.</description>
