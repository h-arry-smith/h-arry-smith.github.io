# Hello :wave:

I'm Harry. I used to tour the world building some of the most ambitous live experiences in the world. Now I'm using those same skills to build web experiences. I'm bored of products that suck and business more interested in pumping your wallet dry than improving your life. So I've decided to do something about it and build my own.

You can read about my journey [here.](/about)

Get a load of what I'm doing right [now.](/now)
