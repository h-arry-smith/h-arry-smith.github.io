# About Me.

:wave: Hey, I'm Harry. I'm one of a triplet living in the south of the UK.  
\
I've got a _1st Class BA Hons in Professional Production Skills_ from the University of Surrey. For the many who won't know; it's a degree on how build and design live entertainment and theatre.

Since graduating in 2016, I've worked across Europe & the UK. Touring arena & stadium music concerts and big one-off events. I've also worked in the corporate, live TV, advertisement, fashion and award ceremonies.

As you might of guessed, **2020** threw my life to the dogs.

Not content with waiting for the music to play, I'm transitioning to development. No career change is easy, but I've dedicated myself to it.

It's my belief that the right system, the right tool - at the right time - can fundamentally alter the path of someones life. People undergo metamorphisis when they have systems that work for them. I'm fascinated by the potential of technology to generate lasting, meaningful change.

I love to explore new ideas, challenges and hobbies. You can see what I'm up to [now](/now).
