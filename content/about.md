# About me.

:wave: Hey, I'm Harry. I'm one of a triplet living in the south of the UK.  
\
I've got a _1st Class BA Hons in Professional Production Skills_ from the University of Surrey. For the many who won't know; it's a degree on how build and design live entertainment and theatre.  
\
Since graduating in 2016, I've worked across Europe & the UK. Touring arena & stadium music concerts and big one-off events. I've also worked in the corporate, live TV, advertisement, fashion and award ceremonies.  
\
As you might of guessed, **2020** threw my life to the dogs.  
\
Not content with waiting for the music to play, I'm building a new future one brick at a time.  
\
Software and web technology can transform lives. I am fascinated by this. I'm using this rare opportunity to immerse myself in development.  
\
I love to explore new ideas, challenges and hobbies. You can see what I'm up to [now](/now), but here's what gets me out of bed every morning:
  * Planning expeditions to cultures and places that challenge my values
  * Thinking about how well designed systems are the key to success
  * Chalking up and climbing hard
  * Reading everything I can get my hands on
  * Understanding why so many people don't love cooking
