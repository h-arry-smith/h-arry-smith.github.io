RedditView is a minimal React/Redux reddit viewer, using the reddit JSON API. This project has been built for the CodeCademy Full Stack Career Path, as part of the portfolio projects.

You can view this project live on [Github Pages](https://h-arry-smith.github.io/reddit-view/)

## Learning Aims
* Create a self directed project, making design and implementation decision independantly, and understanding their advantages and trade offs.
* Adhere to best practices to the best of my ability
* Experiment with unit, integration and end to end testing
* Use git & github projects to manage the development process
* Create a beautiful, interactive, mobile-first design using TailwindCSS

## Technology
* React 17
* Redux 7
* React-Router v5
* TailwindCSS 2.0

## Future Work
This project is limited in scope as to maxamise the learning by focusing on key ideas and then take them to new projects. These leaves plenty of options for expanding on this work.
* Currently only shows top level comments, this could be expanded to show all the comments
* User pages
* Better support for video cards
* Refactor reddit utility and components to better seperate concerns and presentation / container (something I learnt a lot about on this project!)
