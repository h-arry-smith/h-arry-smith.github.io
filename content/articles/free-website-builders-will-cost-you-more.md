Customers first point of contact with your business is more and more likely to be your website.

If you've been looking at getting a new website for your business or project you know they aren't cheap. 

Costs range from anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand pounds. Website builders seem an attractive option for cost conscious business owners.

Yet, these costs saving do not cover the thousands you could be losing from a poor design.

The modern website is a complex product. The only way to guarantee you get a solution that works is to **hire a professional**.

## How much is your time worth?

If your in business your time is best spent satisfying your customers. Not building a website.

How much do you value a day of your time for? How much did the website cost if it takes you a day? a week? a month?
You might think that the "drag and drop" nature of these builders would make building your site faster. This is rarely the case. They can not match the productivity of an experienced web developer.

What seemed like a quick afternoon of work soon ends up _costing you thousands._

## The Modern Web is Difficult

Creating websites for the modern web is difficult. It's a process that requires hand finessing.

A website created from of the shelf parts will never meet your needs. Your business and customers are unique, and you need a unique solution to cater for them.

A professional web developer works with you. They  dig deep to figure out what works best for your particular needs.

## A professional knows what you need.. and what you don't.

Imagine your house needs new plumbing. You wouldn't go to your local home store and buy a bunch of pipes and start ripping up your floorboards.

Don't do the same with your website.

By hiring a developer you ensure that _right problems_ are being solved in the _right way_.

## Focus on your customers, not your site content

I'm sure you've visited plenty of websites with out of date information. Or even worse, broken links.

What impression do you get from their website? **not good**.

Don't let your customers get the same impression of you.
Spend your time creating value. Be confident that someone is looking after your web presence for you. Make sure you always put the right foot forwards.

# Don't lose anymore customers, hire a web developer.

Now you've got a better understanding of why website builders aren't the good idea they look like. When you hire a web developer you will save time. You get a fit for purpose website tailored to your needs. You can focus on what you care about most - _generating value for your business_.
