# now.

I’m currently **working on** the CodeCademy [Full Stack Developer](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) career path. I'm getting distracted along the way.  
\
I’m focused on **building** out this website, and making it useful.  
\
I’m **reading** The Pragmatic Programmer by _Andrew Hunt_ and _David Thomas_.  
\
I’m **learning** all about leather craft at the moment. I’ve been making wallets over and over.  
\
I can’t go **climbing** at the moment, but as soon as I can, I’ll be down the wall as much as possible. In the mean time, I’m focusing on building up my gymnastic strength.  
\
I’m **cooking** up some Kombucha. Fermentation is new to me. I'm trying my best not to poison anyone.  
\
I’m **excited** for 2021. I’ve been spending a lot of time in careful review. The world is a tricky place at the moment, and the way forward isn’t always obvious. I’m hopeful that this will all come together this year.
