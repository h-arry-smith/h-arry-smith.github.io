# Now

I’m currently **working on** the CodeCademy [Full Stack Developer](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) career path. I'm getting distracted along the way.

I’m focused on **building** websites for my first professional clients, with some exciting projects on the way.

I’m **reading** Essentialism by _Greg McKeown_.

I’m **learning** all about leather craft at the moment. I’ve been making wallets over and over.

I can’t go **climbing** at the moment, but as soon as I can, I’ll be down the wall as much as possible. In the mean time, I’m focusing on building up my gymnastic strength.

I’m **cooking** up some Kombucha. Fermentation is new to me. I'm trying my best not to poison anyone.

I’m **excited** for 2021. I’ve been spending a lot of time in careful review. The world is a tricky place at the moment, and the way forward isn’t always obvious. I’m hopeful that this will all come together this year.
